    <h1>Hobbies:</h1>
    <p style="padding-left: 25px;padding-top: 10px;">Having a hobby that we enjoy brings us joy and enriches our lives. It gives us something fun to do during our leisure time and affords us the opportunity to learn new skills. <br> We are very fortunate to have so many different options out there today. In fact, there are entire websites devoted to hobbies and inter- ests. It helps to relieve stress by keeping <br> you engaged in something you enjoy. Hobbies give you a way to take your mind off the stresses of everyday life. They let you relax and seek pleasure in activities that aren't <br> associated with work, chores or other responsibilities. Hobbies help you become more patient.</p>

    <p>My hobby is playing cricket. It makes me feel fresh and energetic. <br> I play it daily with my friends in the playground, behind <br> my house. Playing outdoor games makes you physically fit .</p>

    <img src="photgr.webp" width="400px;"style="padding-top:10px;">
    <p>In general, photography as a hobby can be a great source of comfort, <br> especially if you do it on your own. For example, going for a walk to <br> take landscape photos will expose you to fresh air and help you <br> connect with nature.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="swim" data-aos="fade-down-left">
    <h2>4:Swimming:</h2>
    <img src="swim.jpg" width="400px;"style="padding-top:10px;">
    <p>Swimming is a hobby that can last a lifetimeâ€”plus, it's a great <br> way to get a whole-body workout, regardless of the season.It <br> eases stress. I love being outside in the summer.
     It's a great <br> calorie burner.</p>

   <div class="diving" data-aos="flip-left">
    <h2>5:Sky diving:</h2>
    <img src="skydive.jpg" width="400px;"style="padding-top:10px;">
    <p>The first great advantage of picking skydiving up as a hobby is <br> that you will have regular physical workouts. Although skydiving <br> does not burn as many calories as for example running, it still <br> burns more than many gym activities.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="starg" data-aos="fade-down-left"  >
    <h2>6:Stargazing: </h2>
    <img src="op.jfif" width="400px;"style="padding-top:10px;">
    <p>Stargazing is an incredible hobby, as you take the time to learn <br> more about the universe you live in. Evidently, this requires <br> more than looking at the sky, how to get started properly so <br> that you can make the most of this new interest</p>
   </div>
   <div class="mountain" data-aos="fade-right" >
    <h2>7:Mountain climbing:</h2>
    <img src="mountin.jfif" width="400px;"style="padding-top:10px;">
    <p>Mountaineering is a lifelong philosophy rather than a mere hobby. <br> Unlike most other extreme sports, mountaineering is uniquely <br> suited to be a lifelong hobby rather than a one-time experience</p>
